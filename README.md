# 🅿️ Smart Parking Guidance System

A real-time embedded system that recommends the nearest available parking slot using Dijkstra’s algorithm. Combines IR sensor data from Arduino Mega, Python Flask backend, and a dynamic web UI for live parking slot updates.

---

## 💡 Objective

To design a smart parking system that:
- Detects availability of parking slots using IR sensors
- Calculates the shortest path from entrance to available slots
- Recommends the nearest available slot
- Visually displays the parking map with real-time updates
